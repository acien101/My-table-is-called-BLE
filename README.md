# My-table-is-called-BLE
Repository with the files of my table. The table has a led strip of 60 RGB leds with an arduino and a BLE (Bluetooth low energy). 

In this repository there are the code of the arduino, and the android applicacion to controll the led strip.

##Arduino
Arduino is the microcontroller that sends the data to the led strip. It is a simple strip with the SMD 5050, that have RGB leds. The arduino is conected to a BLE module, the ZS 40.

##Android app
The andorid app is a fork of the proyect [MSMBle](https://github.com/jmgjmg/MSMBle) but modified for our proyect.
